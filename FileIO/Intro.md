PROJECT: SEND AND RECEIVE FILE.
AUTHOR: TUNGHA.

This is my litle project for a litle problem.

MAIN PROBLEM:
    The company where i're working at, use Windows system. Networking sercurity is very strong at there. TCP or UDP is
closed. That makes difficult for us to tranfer data between the company's database and department's database. We have 2
computers. The first one connect to company's database but can not install our database on it. The second one run MongoDB
but can not connect to company's database. Beside, order for authorization is very long long time and difficult. So we 
need a solution to solve this problem.
